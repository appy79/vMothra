  <h3>Lore : </h3>
  <p>Mothra Sacrificed herself to save godzilla in the war with Ghidorah. As usual, after her death she left an egg from which next mothra will be born. But humans as always could not come out of their greedy ways and hid the egg. Mothra is born, but in captivity. Now she has to upgrade herself to get out of the prison she is in.</p>
  <p>Some humans working at the place you are being kept feel that it is wrong to keep you in captivity. You have to now identify those people and ask for help. Identifying those people is going to take time and some skills. So you decide to go on this quest and start identifying them because only by doing that you can upgrade yourself.</p>
  <p>The humans have given clues for you to find them. But when you do find them you have to give explanation on how you found them. If you can't they will not help you and you will remain in captivity forever.  One of the very first things you notice is that these humans use some kind of numbers to address each other and you must do the same.</p>
  <p>You just saw a person going into his room and you believe that he is one of those humans. You go to the door and try to open it but cannot. the door is locked with a puzzle on it. You try to see what is the puzzle about. You see that it has a table and some terms are there like "deque" "pop" etc and you immediately deduce that Data Structures has something to do with it. Now you pride yourselves on DS knowledge. So you go ahead and try to undertand it. But everything is not what it seems. Horizontal is vertical, Vertical is horizontal. One thing you do know that after applying all operations you will get a number specific to the person inside. These people really don't like being called by their names it seems. Numbers are the way to go then.</p>
  <p>You input the person's number correctly and realize that maybe that is what you need to do everytime because after all these humans really don't like words. The first person was an easy find because after solving the puzzle you got the number directly. After getting the required upgrade you start searching for the next person. The next person as you recall was in the truck that carried you here. It had this lion kinda logo on it. Also you were hit by a thing with flat surface to knock you unconscious. These two things are your only ways to him. In the search for the first person you got the number directly. Maybe this time you will get some other detail of the person. One thing you know for sure. All details you need are in the folder given to you by Godzilla at the start of hunt. So you go out to find this particular detail about the next person using the two clues given to you.</p>
  <p>About the next person you know that he works at two of the facilities of this organisation. And the only clues you have are some Data Structures. So you use your DS knowledge and apply some operations to get the answer. You call him and ask to meet.</p>
  <p>The next person as you recall is a full stack memer. He keeps almost 10 apps on his mobile for making memes. He is also a weaver and can create wonderful weaves. He has weaved some fine material for the organisation and that is what lead you to this hunt. Without him you would never have gotten to know about this hunt for humans who can help you upgrade.</p>
  <p>After the weaver you can't seem to find your next target. The only clue you find when you reach at his home are some numbers. When you try to solve it you can't seem to get a proper number. Only assumptions. So you seek out help from Godzilla. But he refuses to help you with this because being a King of all Monsters he has a lot of work to do and is busy in administration work. But he doesn't want you to abondon hope and leave everything. You are dear to him and thus he gives you a small hint. "Birthdate" and goes away into the open waters of the ocean. Also he gives you a protective shield that would allow you one more crack at this equation. You know the answer is not as simple as it seems. But you gotta work with what you have.</p>
  <p>You see that you have to make a date of birth from these numbers. So you make try various ways to get one. You replace the ? with /(separators) for DOB. Next you see that the mathematical operators given are not giving correct result. Seems the operators are swapped(like minus for divide) because only then it does make a meaningful DOB. So you take the DOB and start doing research on it. All the employees of the organisation are too young to have this DOB. So this means that it is just another clue. So you search for the birthday on web and you find a few famous people that have this birthdate. One of the persons you found have created something which by using logic from stage 3 you get a name of one of the employees. So you enter the number of that employee and find her. Tip:- Wright brothers haven't got anything to do with it.</p>
